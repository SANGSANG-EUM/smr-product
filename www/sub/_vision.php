              Carbon-free energy is attracting attention to achieve carbon neutrality and respond to the global climate
              crisis. <br> As Korea accelerates the transition to clean energy under the policy of reducing greenhouse gas
              emissions by 40% by 2030, KHNP has been preparing for the future as Korea's representative K-energy company
              and partner. <br> Koreaâ€™s proven zero-carbon energy technology and operational capabilities are It is now
              providing new strength to countries around the world considering carbon-free energy. <br> Based on the
              technology and capabilities we have accumulated over decades, we are introducing safer, more economical, and
              more flexible nuclear energy.

              Nuclear power is attracting attention as a clean energy source that can replace aging coal-fired power
              plants, which is one of the issues that must be urgently addressed for carbon neutrality. <br> i-SMR is the
              optimal alternative to lead the transition to eco-friendly energy by applying the capacity of coal-fired
              power plants
              into consideration from the concept design stage, aiming for world-class safety, economic efficiency at the
              level of large nuclear power plants, and flexibility for flexible operation. <br> As evidenced by the case
              of K-Nuclear Power Plant successfully supporting the use of clean energy in the UAE, KHNP and Team Korea's
              technological and business management capabilities will be the driving force behind the successful
              development of i-SMR, a game changer in eco-friendly energy conversion.

            <div class="vision-txt">Due to the global crisis caused by climate change, sustainable urban development is
              emerging as a key task. <br> KHNP dreams of a city where carbon neutrality and sustainable growth are
              achieved simultaneously through i-SMR-based net zero city. <br> SSNC is an energy innovation platform that
              measures sustainable growth of cities through I-SMR-based net-zero energy and industrial competitiveness
              innovation, It is the CF100 energy mix model that will accelerate the realization of carbon neutrality
              through efficient urban energy production and utilization. <br>
              The use of stable distributed power sources centered on highly economical i-SMR reduces energy consumption
              costs
              by 30% compared to regular cities, while solving the climate crisis caused by excessive resource consumption
              and environmental destruction
              by harmonizing with renewable energy. <br>
