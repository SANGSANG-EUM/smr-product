            <div class="vision-txt">As climate change worsens and a sense of threat grows, there has been a growing demand for sustainable urban development. KHNP is envisioning a i-SMR-based net-zero city where carbon neutrality and sustainable growth harmoniously coexist. <br> SSNC (i-SMR Smart Net Zero City) is an innovative energy platform aiming for sustainable city growth through net-zero energy powered by i-SMR technology and advancements in industrial competitiveness. It is also a CF100 energy mix model crafted to enhance the efficiency of urban energy production and consumption to accelerate carbon neutrality. By leveraging the cost-effective i-SMR technology as the central component of a stable distributed energy system, SSNC will cut energy expenses by 30% compared to ordinary cities. In harmony with renewable energy sources, it addresses climate concerns stemming from over consumption of resources while mitigating environmental degradation. KHNP aims to usher in a net-zero future through SSNC.
