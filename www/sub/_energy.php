            Construction (EPC) turnkey model for NPP delivery, EPC turnkey model for nuclear island delivery plus
            engineering of the NPP. Moreover, Korea has experience about all NPP life cycle starting from construction

                    constructed around the world are being delayed in completion due to a myriad of problems, including
                    first-of-a-kind design issues, faulty materials and equipment, construction quality defects,
                    insufficient early stage design, failure to meet license requirement and weak project management
                    capability. As a result, in some cases, delay has prolonged up to 9 years comparing to the initial plan
                    that incurred huge amount of additional construct costs.</p>
                  <p class="energy-li__txt energy-li__txt1">Korea has continuously conducted multiple types of NPP project
                    in a repeated manner mostly without delay and cost overrun. In addition, current projects in UAE are
                    successfully underway in accordance with initially contracted process in contrast to overseas NPP
                    construction project executed by other suppliers in struggle. The prominent performance of Korea is
                    attributable to its vast experience, sophisticatedly fabricated system as well as high -quality
                    management skill.</p>
                  <p class="energy-li__txt energy-li__txt1">In particular, Korea could achieve on-time NPP constructions
                    through effective interface management and developments of risk minimization plan based on its long-time
                    model experiences.</p>
