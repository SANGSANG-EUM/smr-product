              <p class="energy-li__txt energy-li__txt1">The majority of the new-build nuclear projects currently being constructed around the world are being delayed in completion due to a myriad of problems, including first-of-a-kind design issues, faulty materials and equipment, construction quality defects, insufficient early stage design, failure to meet license requirement and weak project management capability. As a result, in some cases, delay has prolonged up to 9 years comparing to the initial plan that incurred huge amount of additional construct costs.</p>
              <p class="energy-li__txt energy-li__txt1">Korea has continuously conducted multiple types of NPP project in a repeated manner mostly without delay and cost overrun. In addition, current projects in UAE are successfully underway in accordance with initially contracted process in contrast to overseas NPP construction project executed by other suppliers in struggle. The prominent performance of Korea is attributable to its vast experience, sophisticatedly fabricated system as well as high -quality management skill.</p>
              <p class="energy-li__txt energy-li__txt1">In particular, Korea could achieve on-time NPP constructions through effective interface management and developments of risk minimization plan based on its long-time model experiences.</p>

              <p class="energy-li__txt energy-li__txt1">Over the long period of 40 years, Korea has robustly implemented both domestic (30units) and UAE (4 units) NPP projects. So far, it has seamlessly operated the top-notch NPPS in the world by securing diverse technology organizations and reflecting the improvements learned from its previous project operations.</p>
              <p class="energy-li__txt energy-li__txt1">In Korea, KHNP has executed NPP projects under its overall control ranged from planning, selection of applicable technology, engineering, to quality control. This is possible with continuous and intertwined coordination between KHNP and its partner companies which have ample experience and in-depth expertise as shown below:</p>

In every field of nuclear power project, Korea has secured plenty of skilled experts who can readily put into a new project. The number of engineers is enough to construct as many as 14 units at the same time.</p>
              <p class="energy-li__txt energy-li__txt1">In particular, thanks to repeated NPP construction works, Korea holds a broad labor pool ranged from machinery, electricity, instrumentation/control, tube, civil to quality test that played as a great advantage for the successful i-SMR project.</p>
